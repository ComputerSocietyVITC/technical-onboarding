# Git Basics

In this module we will learn about some basic Git commands.  Git is all about running simple commands that will do the complex job for us. Commands are always ran in the format of `git <command name`. 

Before we dive into it, let us first install Git on our system. Download the version suitable for your operating system from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). After downloading and installing the package, create a folder and use that as your project folder.
